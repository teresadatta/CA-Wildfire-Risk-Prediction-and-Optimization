# CA-Wildfire-Risk-Prediction-and-Optimization
Wildfire Risk Prediction and Response Optimization in California: 
* Exploring Climate Change and Inmate Firefighters 
* Utilizing Random Forest, SMOTE, Constraint Optimization, Mixed-Integer Programming


## Description of Key Notebooks: 

* `california_map.ipynb`: makes chloropleth maps of California to show wildfire risk predictions
* `constaint_data.ipynb`: data wrangling and EDA for firefighter numbers, station locations, and inmate firefighter population in California
* `data_wrangling.ipynb`: data wrangling and EDA for historic wildfire incident, weather, and topographic information used for Tree-based risk prediction model
* `full_analysis.ipynb`: Tree- based risk prediction models taking advantage of undersampling approaches
* `optimization.ipynb`: Mixed Integer Programming work for Optimal firefighter allocation
